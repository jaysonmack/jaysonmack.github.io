# Digital Humanities Final Portfolio
Hi! My name is Jayson Mack and I am from Long Island, New York. I am a sophomore 
at the University of Pennsylvania studying Philosophy, Politics, and Economics. This semester
I had the pleasure of taking an Introduction to Digital Humanities class, where I had the 
opportunity to complete various projects by analyzing large sets of data and metadata.
Here are my final takeaways from this class. I hope you enjoy it!


# Final Recap Statement of the course
When I first stepped into this class at the beginning of the semester, I had no idea what the digital humanities field consisted of. Making inferences through its name, I predicted that it had something to do with the humanities field and the internet, but I had no idea how the field connected the two distinct worlds. However, nearing my completion of this introductory course in a growing field, I now understand the role that the internet plays in this field. There are some positives and some negatives, but nonetheless, the internet plays a vital role in shaping the digital humanities field as well as contributing to the evolution of the field as time goes on. A major theme that I found to reappear throughout this course is how technological innovations have changed the landscape of the digital humanities field.

First, in the reading Material/Digital, authors Zachary Lesser and Whitney Trettien highlight the relationship between physical objects and the digital copy of that object. The reproduction of physical objects, texts, and data is a big part of what the digital humanities field entails, and advanced technology has transformed this process to a level that archivists could never have predicted 20 years ago. In this specific article, my main takeaway was how the power of technology and the digital world allowed humans to better understand archival documents through the use of screen rotation and changing the color of backgrounds. This is powerful because legibility can be a major problem when trying to perform archival research, but now we can use digital tools and spaces to help solve issues that have not been solvable in the past. With the power to understand a broader number of documents out there in the world, there are now more credible archives that can be used in various research studies.

This article resonated with me ever since we spent a class in the Kislak Center for Rare Books, Manuscripts, Special Collections, and the Schoenberg Center for Electronic Text and Image. Being able to witness the precision of the advanced technology that goes into getting these physical texts digitized truly amazed me, especially considering the funding that the University has put into all of the technology that the center utilizes to achieve its goals. I feel like a big goal throughout this class was to understand the importance of preserving and analyzing older documents that would otherwise be viewed as useless; however, aspects of the digital humanities field allow these documents’ lifespans to be eternal. Even though I was honestly wary of the Kislak Center due to its very discreet location on the first floor of Van Pelt Library, one aspect I found very fascinating was the emphasis on the lighting and the attention to detail that the researchers had to apply in order for the specialized technology to work its magic.

Witnessing the process of texts and documents being published to the web soon had a deeper meaning once I went upstairs and actually had the opportunity to put my hands on older documents. Even though it is becoming a lost art in today’s world due to the rapid emergence of technology and the internet, I also enjoyed scrolling through the pages of archival documents such as old prison records or even W.E.B. Du Bois’s 7th Ward Map. Firstly, I was able to truly live the experiences that Professors Trettien and Lesser drew upon in their work, experiencing the troubles that come with attempting to read texts that were manufactured centuries ago. Secondly, I enjoyed having the ability to care for the material through physical touch, which I feel brought more life and purpose to the documents.

Even though I still believe that it is powerful that certain rare archival texts are widely accessible to the world now due to the work of people in the field of digital humanities, I believe that having the opportunity to handle physical texts and archives allows for a researcher to have a deeper connection with the material. This relates to a class conversation and a musical cassette workshop that I attended. I had the opportunity to curate my own musical cassette, and the material aspect of the workshop gave me a new appreciation for the material, which reminded me of a conversation we had in class regarding digital surrogates and how digital playlists lose a lot of the customization aspect that comes with music.

Lastly, an interest that I discovered of mine through the exploration of the digital humanities field is the preservation of memories and collections, specifically directed towards the Black experience in America. Our history, experience, and memories have been erased so many times throughout history, and Dorothy Berry ignited this passion of mine to preserve our history in the House of Archives reading that was assigned in the beginning weeks of class. I applied these concepts through my research of the role barbershops played in Eastern State Penitentiary because I knew that the memories and experiences of barbershops dating back to the 19th century all play a role in how prevalent barbershops are in our communities today. The ability to ensure that experiences live on forever is very powerful, and that is something that draws me to further explore and contribute to the art of digital humanities in the future.


# Looking Forward 
To wrap out, I will be listing three goals that I have that this exposure to the digital humanities field
has brought upon me. Coming into this class having no prior knowledge of the field, I was able to learn
a lot and the work I did sparked my interest, influencing me to further my studies within the field.

1. Learn how to code.
   Within this course, we utilized markdown code syntax to report on our projects that came from analyzing
   data and metadata. However, in the future, I would love to learn how to use coding techniques to dissect
   large data sets, and then perhaps using markdown to report my findings on a website.

2. Research Dorthy Berry
   I would love to read more of Dorthy Berry's work, as I find it very interesting how she can rewrite
   forgotten history for the world to know the truth. I feel like in order to have an understanding
   of the world today you must understand the history that led us to this point, which is why
   I would love to learn more about Dorthy Berry's research, specifically her publication "Black America," 1895.

3. Familiarize myself with Tinkercard
   After working on projects and attending workshops at the Education Commons, I realized that there are so many
   cool resources and technology that Penn offers to students for free. Something that stuck out to me was that I
   learned all Penn students have free access to a 3D printer for 50 hours a semester. I was able to witness the
   brilliance of the 3D printer during the process of visualizing data for my collaboration project. Tinkercard,
   the software we used to create models to be 3D printed, was very foreign to me and I'm glad my group project fabricator,
    was able to create our model. Although, I look forward to learning how to use the software so I can make cool
   decorations for my dorm room!
